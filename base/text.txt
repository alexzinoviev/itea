Project Gutenberg offers over 53,000 free ebooks: choose among free epub books, free kindle books, download them or read them online.

We carry high quality ebooks: Most Project Gutenberg ebooks were previously published by bona fide publishers. We digitized and diligently proofread them with the help of thousands of volunteers.

No fee or registration is required, but if you find Project Gutenberg useful, we kindly ask you to donate a small amount so we can buy and digitize more books, maintain our online presence, and improve Project Gutenberg programs and offerings. Other ways to help include digitizing more books, recording audio books, or reporting errors.

Many more free ebooks are available through our Partners, Affiliates and Resources.
